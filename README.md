Workflow Guide
Creating a Feature Branch
Start by creating a new branch for any feature or bug fix:

bash
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
Replace <feature-name> with a meaningful branch name, like login or signup.

Making Changes
Add and commit your changes:

bash
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Add <feature-description>"
Pushing Changes
Push the branch to GitHub:

bash
git push origin feature/<feature-name>
Opening a Pull Request (PR)

Go to your GitHub repository.
Open a pull request (PR) from feature/<feature-name> to main.
Add a title and description to the PR.
Request a review from a collaborator.
Code Review and Merging

Reviewers provide feedback and approve changes.
After approval, merge the PR into main and delete the feature branch.
Example Files
This project contains the following example files:

login.py: Implements the login functionality.
signup.py: Implements the signup functionality.
Example Usage
After cloning, you can test each feature by running the individual Python scripts:

bash
python login.py
python signup.py
Each script will output a message indicating the feature is active.

Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Ensure each feature or bug fix is developed on its own branch.
